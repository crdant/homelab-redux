# PCF Homelab, Redux

Since I [first automated my homelab setup](https://github.com/crdant/homelab), I've learned a bit more about Terraform and
Pivotal has learned a bit more about providing a clean bootstrap experience. This repo is my attempt to redo the lab in
a cleaner way informed by those learnings.
